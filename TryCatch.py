'''
The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.
The except block lets you handle the error.
The finally block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

#The try block will generate an exception, because x is not defined:
try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("An exception occurred")
#output:An exception occurred


#Print one message if the try block raises a NameError and another for other errors:
try:
    print(x)
except NameError:
    print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
    print("Something else went wrong")

#output:Variable x is not defined


#In this example, the try block does not generate any error:
try:
    print("Hello")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
else:
    print("Nothing went wrong")
'''
output:
Hello
Nothing went wrong

#The finally block, if specified, will be executed regardless if the try block raises an error or not.
